This example shows the details of how to post a custom header. to submit custom headers to the server, we need to use Postman. 

Get - used to retrive data from the servers, the data is appended to the URL. So in the URL we see the data and we called them query string parameters

POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE - used to manupilate data in database by sending data to the server. 
this data will go in the message body, not in the header, seperated from the URL. 
the data can be sent as URL encoded data or in jsom formated. in html forms, the default is URL encoded.
